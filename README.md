# Optimized Character Frequency Analysis in C  
*A performance-optimized character frequency analysis tool with automated testing and profiling.*

## 🔹 Overview  
This project implements an **efficient character frequency analysis** program in C, designed to count occurrences of letters in a given text file. It features **two implementations**—a naive approach and an optimized version—allowing for **benchmarking and performance comparisons**. The project includes **automated unit testing** using the Criterion framework and **performance profiling** via Gprof and GCov.

## 🚀 Features  
✅ **Two Implementations** – A standard and an optimized version to compare efficiency  
✅ **Automated Unit Testing** – Comprehensive test coverage using the Criterion framework  
✅ **Performance Profiling** – Integrated Gprof and GCov support for execution analysis  
✅ **Cross-Platform Compatibility** – Configurable Makefile for Linux and macOS builds  

## ⚙️ Technologies Used  
- **C** for core implementation  
- **Criterion** for unit testing  
- **Gprof & GCov** for profiling and coverage analysis  
- **Makefile** for build automation  

## 🔧 How to Run  
1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/char-freq-analysis.git  
   cd char-freq-analysis
2. **Build and run tests**  
   ```sh
   make andRunTests   
3. **Run Performance Profiling**  
   ```sh
   make andRunPerformance
